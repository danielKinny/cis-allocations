this is a node.js program to handle applications for these competitions the school usually hosts.
the allocation process is typically time consuming due to the sheer volume of applications recieved through google forms.
this program uses node.js libraries such as csv-parser and xlsx to facilitate the automation of application processing, by parsing the CSV file, using an algorithm to allocate them, and then writing it to an excel file.

the algorithm checks whether each student's first preference of committee is full, if it is, then it checks the second preference,
in a worst-case scenario, any participants whose preferences are both full, are allocated to a seperate table to be manually assigned by event organisers.

to run the program, install node.js on your computer, then go ahead and type this into your terminal

git clone https://github.com/danielKinny/cis-allocations.git
cd cis-allocations
npm i
node allocation.js

and boom you have a file called allocations.xlsx which is a formatted excel file containing all the allocations.
if you wanna delete the files created run the following command:
node reset.js

however all of the file paths are hardcoded into the allocation program, so if those are changed then reset.js will return an error.
the input.csv file contains about 85 ish sample participants that were generated by copilot, ive given the format used to create each object in allocation.js
additionally note that all the committees are also hardcoded, meaning that if more committees are to be added, they can by adding them to committees.json, the program will respond dynamically
